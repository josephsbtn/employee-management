# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to this project! The following is a minimal set of guidelines to help you get started.

- File issues for bugs or feature requests using the repository Issues tab.
- Fork the repository and create a feature branch named like `feat/short-description` or `fix/short-description`.
- Write tests for bug fixes and new features. Run tests locally with:

```powershell
pytest -q
```

- Keep changes focused and small. Use descriptive commit messages.
- Run the test suite and linters (if configured) before opening a pull request.
- Use existing code style and match surrounding conventions (PEP8 for Python). Consider using `black` / `flake8` locally.

Maintainers will review PRs and provide feedback. Thanks for contributing!
